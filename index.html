<p>The Spanish Easter holidays end on Easter monday, and prices in La Palma are very reasonable after that time, with hotel rooms and apartments below or around 100 EUR.</p>

<p>La Palma is a spectacular place for hiking, and it has some very nice beaches. Star gazing is among the best in the world, and if there is interest we may be able to organise something.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing you in La Palma!</p>
